The more you use it, the more it becomes part of your daily routine, bringning major improvements to your productivity.";
"Answer_5" = "You should experiment over a few weeks and try to figure out what the optimum amount for you is. A good tip to help figure out what works best for you is this: after finishing each pomodoro, give your state of mind a grade on a scale from 1 to 10 and after a few weeks try comparing the results. The numbers should speak for themselves.";
